### Hi there 👋

#### I'm ベンジー and I'm 15.

#### I'm an experienced programmer in multiple languages and I've been programming since I was around 5-6 (10 years of experience)

### The programming languages I'm fluent in are:
- C++
- C#
- VB.NET
- Java
- C
- [LINGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(programming_language))
- Fortran 77
- Lua
- Python (though I don't like to use it unless I have to, python bad)
- Delphi
- ActionScript
- Go

I sometimes do x86 asm but i'm not the best at it

##### My main focus is usually games and software, but I occasionally do AI
